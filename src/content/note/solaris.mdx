title: 'Solaris'

import L from '../../components/L.astro'

Today I was experimenting with installing Solaris in a Vultr VPS, the process was pretty simple,
upload the latest iso to the ISO library, run it, most things left default.

You can go to Settings > IPv4 to get the IP, netmask and gateway configuration and you are set.
I enabled the SSH service and created an admin user.

After that I wanted to run erlang/elixir in this system, it is not there in the repos so I proceeded to
<L name="compile-erlang-elixir" from="solaris" />.
