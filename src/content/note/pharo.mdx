A lot of people commented that what I was talking about was very much what
Smalltalk offered in many of their Desktop environments.

I really need to expand more into this and learn more about
[Pharo](https://pharo.org/). I've tested Pharo before a couple of
years ago, and while very interesting the transition from prototype to
production didn't seem the most straightforward. I need to give it a
deeper try, particularly around the prototyping stage (Although being
able to move into production is something that is necessary for me,
since it is also another source of rigidness).
