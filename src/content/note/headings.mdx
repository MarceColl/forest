title: 'Headings'

import L from '../../components/L.astro';

Avoid too many levels of headings to avoid having to make each visually distinct.

I settle for 2 levels.

They reveal the structure of your arguments.


Typographic parameters:

+ Don't use all caps.
+ Don't underline.
+ Don't center.
+ The best way to emphasize is by putting space above and below.
+ Use bold, not italic.
+ Point size should only be a little bigger.
+ Suppress <L name="type-composition" text="hyphenation" from="headings" />.
