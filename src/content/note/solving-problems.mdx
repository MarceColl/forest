title: 'Solving problems with computers'

Lately I've been thinking more and more about what it means for a program to be useful. I'm feeling more and more that when I attempt to solve a problem with a program, as I solve the original problem the problem tends to expand in such a way that we didn't actually solve too much.

This is just a problem of my approach at problem solving and not inherent to solving problems with computers as a whole I think. However I think it's important we take it into account.

In order to help me tackle this I'm trying to work more and more in solving problems with <L name="forth" from="solving-problems" /> since it seems that it helps me reduce the scope into only whatever problem I had at the start.

An example of this reduced scope is my expense tracking program: <L name="project-money" from="solving-problems" />
