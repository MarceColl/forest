It needs openssl, libyaml, zlib, autoconf.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ruby/ruby.git
$ ./autogen.sh
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ mkdir ~/.rubies
$ ../configure --prefix="${HOME}/.rubies/ruby-master"
$ make
$ make install
```

Weirdly enough, `make` doesn't build all the binaries, you need to run `make install` in order to have all the normal ruby binaries (irb, bundler, gem, etc).
