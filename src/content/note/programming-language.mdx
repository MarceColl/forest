import L from '../../components/L.astro'

Lately when <L name="programming" from="programming-language" /> I mostly dabble in <L name="forth" from="programming-language" /> and Common Lisp.

At work I use Ruby and have previously used a lot of Python and Typescript at work.

For a while I enjoyed Rust but lately I find it very tedious, I've gone from one side to the other in the dynamically-statically typed spectrum.
