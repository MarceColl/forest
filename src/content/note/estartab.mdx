import L from '../../components/L.astro'

This is a file in <L name='plan-9' from='estartab' /> that contains star informa
tion in a tabular format. I haven't found much information about this file in 
the internet. And there doesn't seem to be a man page for it. Just a reference
from the astro man page. Here is what I was able to understand from reading the 
source of
the plan-9 program 
[astro](https://github.com/9fans/plan9port/blob/master/src/cmd/astro/stars.c#L39-L64).

It is part of the SAO (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory) Star Catalog.[^1] [^2] [^3]
The file is composed of many entries in a tabular format, here is a sample row:

```
190556      30359 21 38 58.207 -.0003 -20 02 04.87 -0.007 .00  7.06  K0
```

This corresponds to [this star](http://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=SAO+190556&submit=SIMBAD+search), 
cross-referencing the line above with the values in simbad I see the estartab
uses the <L name='fk4' from='estartab' /> coordinate system with (ep=B1950 eq=1950)
[I'm still unsure what this means, epoch is B1950 and the equinox is 1950, but unsure
what equinox=1950 means).

From what I understand of this, an a<L name='astronomy-epoch' from='estartab' /> is a 
particular point in time that serves as reference. In this case the epoch is B1950, which is 
the <L name='besselian-year' from='estartab' /> 1950.

Here's my attempt at understanding all of these parameters:

1. `190556` is the SAO catalog ID.
2. `30359` General catalog[^5] number. Seems it's not used by astro.
3. `21` is called the `rah` internally, it is the hour part of the right ascension.
4. `38` is called the `ram` internally, it is the minute part of the right ascension.
5. `58.207` is called the `ras` internally, it is the seconds part of the right ascension.
6. `-.0003` is called the `da`, it seems some kind of correction to the ascension.
7. `-20` is called the `dday`, it's part of the declination. Normally would be called degrees [^4]
8. `02` is called the `dmin`, it's part of the declination. Normally minutes.
9. `04.87` is called the `dsec`, it's part of the declination. Normally seconds.
10. `-0.007` is called the `dd`. It is used in `astro/star.c`. It seems some kind of correction to the declination.
11. `.00` is the `px`. It doesn't seem to be used. Maybe related to the positional error as described in [^3]
12. `7.06` is the `mag`. The star magnitude.

In this row the <L name='right-ascension' from='estartab' /> is $21\degree 38'  58.207"$ and the
declination is $-20\degree 02' 04.87"$.
