A tour of non-alphabetic characters and their usage.

# Curly quotes

Use curly quotes instead of straight quotes.
In webpages you can use the `<q>` tag, for example:
```html
<q>Like this</q>
```
<q>Like this</q>

# Question Mark

You can use the question mark to make sentences shorter.

> We now turn our attention to the issue of whether Munchausen syndrome was diagnosed before the 1960s.

into

> Was Munchausen syndrome diagnosed before the 1960s?

# Semicolon (;)

1. Used instead of a conjunction to combine two sentences (*He did the crime; he must do the time*).
2. Separates list elements with internal commas: (We visited Tulsa, Oklahoma; Flint, Michigan; Paducah, Kentucky).

# Colon (:)

Connects the introduction of an idea and its completion (*I own three cars: a convertible, a sedan, and a minivan).

# Marks

**Paragraph Mark (¶)**

When citing documents with sequentially numbered paragraphs.

**Section Mark (§)**

When citing documents with numbered or lettered sections.

# Parenthesis, brackets, and braces

*Parenthesis* are for separating citations or other asides from the body text. *Brackets* show changes within quoted material. *Braces* are not typically used except in technical and mathematical writing.

# Hyphens and Dashes

A *hyphen* appears at the end of a line when a word breaks onto the next line. *Dashes* come in two sizes, the *em* dash (—) and the *en* dash (–).

The *em dash* is used to make a break between parts of a sentence.

# Spacing

The *non-breaking space* allows you to keep words on the same line. In html you can use `&nbsp;`.
