This will be my log journal for [December Adventure](https://eli.li/december-adventure). I have several plans for it:

* Continue my Common Lisp [Vera](https://wiki.nova-lang.net/index.php?title=A_Raven%27s_Flyby_of_Vera) implementation.
  * Check my vastly outdated <L name="nova" from="decadv" /> page. Will update soon.
  * I would like to test the idea of a Vera/Mira OS and how that would look like overlayed over the Common Lisp version.
* Work on my rewriting videogame.
  * The idea is to be a wizard, and spells are small visual rewriting programs that allow you to understand the fabric
    of reality and change it to your whim. As you advance you get small reagents that you can add and modify in your
    spellbook.
* Work on a realistic japanese calligraphy generative rendering.
  * As a <L name="shakuhachi" from="decadv" /> player, I'd like to have a nice way to practice my songs, I wanted to
    create a way for people to practice songs online, in a minimalistic setting, possibly with microphone recording
    to record your sessions and compare with the originals (?). Trying to mimic the way shakuhachi has been tought for
    centuries from your home.

I'm currently in Japan for a month with my family (partner and 10-month old daughter), so I don't know how much I'll be
able to do. But I'll try to get things done and write about them here and there while on downtime from visiting Japan.

Thanks to the Vera community on Discord for encouraging this December Adventure!
