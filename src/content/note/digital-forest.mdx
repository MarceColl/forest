title: "Digital Forest"

import L from '../../components/L.astro'

I've called this page a Digital Forest instead of a digital garden, because while a garden usually implies some sense of order and a small size the forest implies you can get lost and be in places you don't know.

This is a bit of an experiment, an idea on how to create a system that helps you go down rabbit holes of information.

This system is built with <L name="astro" from="digital-forest" /> and <L name="htmx" from="digital-forest" />.

Initially partially inspired by [this astro theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/the-technonomicon/j)
