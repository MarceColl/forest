Inspired by the [Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).

The notion is to have computer-supported thinking. Let insight accumulate by taking notes and linking them very densely (<L name="backlinks" from="evergreen-notes" /> help basically duplicate the amount of links for free).

Some important notes extracted from there
 + *Evergreen Notes* should be atomic
 + *Evergreen Notes* should be concept-oriented
 + *Evergreen Notes* should be written for yourself by default, disregarding audience.

 This last point is why sometimes you will find disconnected ideas here. Feel free to <L name="about-me" from="evergreen-notes" text="reach out" /> if you find one of those and you want to elaborate or work on them.

 [Evergreen Notes as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zR6RRbCfY5rFkiimFnaJZKB)

 Have an <L name="inbox" from="evergreen-notes" /> to capture notes and reading inputs.
