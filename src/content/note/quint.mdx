[Quint](https://quint-lang.org) is a formal methods language by the creators of the Apalache symbolic model checker
for TLA+.

Quint is not a <L name="programming" from="quint" /> <L name="programming-language" from="quint" text="language" />, but an executable spec language. I believe the difference is the objective,
a programming language main objective is computation, while an executable spec language main objective is verification.

Some languages like Agda, Liquid Haskell, etc blur the lines a bit.
