title: 'HTMX'

[HTMX](https://htmx.org) extends the hypertext protocol for interactive webpages. This page you're using right now (if you have javascript enabled) is mostly implemented using HTMX.

For example, every note link that you click is defined like this

```html
<a href={`/note/${name}`}
   hx-get={`/note/${name}`}
   hx-target="closest .note"
   hx-select=".note"
   hx-swap="afterend">{note.data.title.trim()}</a>
```

What does this mean? When someone clicks that anchor, htmx will send a `GET` request to `/note/${name}`, then it will take the `.note` element from the response (specified by `hx-select`) and put it after (specified by `hx-swap`) the closest `.note` element in the current page (specified by `hx-target`).

With a couple of attributes that mostly follow existing hypertext conventions you can check implement interactive webpages in minutes.

Similarly closing a note is also done through `HTMX`.

```html
<span class="close-note"
      hx-get="data:text/html,"
      hx-trigger="click"
      hx-target="closest .note"
      hx-swap="delete">
  [close]
</span>
```

It seems that HTMX requires a request in order to do a trigger, so the `hx-get="data:text/html` is a trick to do that without having to actually do a request.
