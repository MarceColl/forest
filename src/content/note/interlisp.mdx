The original OS of the Xerox Lisp Machines has some interesting ideas
that are very similar to what I thought about. Mainly related to
avoiding the File-based and file organization problems.

It was able to keep track of what was modified and what was new and
update the files with the new definitions. They called this the
"resident mode". You can read more about this and other interlisp
goodies in

There's been a recent effort by the Medley <L name="interlisp" /> organization to
port the original Interlisp into modern OSs, with people from the
original design involved. I'll write more about Interlisp in future
posts.

You can check Interlisp out on their [website](https://interlisp.org).
You can check the conversation where Interlisp was brought to my
attention

In the hacker news discussion there are also some references to Interlisp.
Make sure to check those as well :)
