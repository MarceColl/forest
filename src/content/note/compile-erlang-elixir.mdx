# Erlang

The general gist of it is:

```
$ wget <tarball_url>
$ tar xzf <tarball_file> && cd <tarball_folder>
$ ./configure --prefix=<install path> --with-dynamic-trace=dtrace --disable-year2038
$ gmake
```

The `--with-dynamic-trace=dtrace` enables the BEAM dtrace probes.

# In Solaris/OmniOS

When attempting to compile this in <L name="solaris" from="compile-erlang-elixir" /> I had the following error:

```
 GEN    /home/marce/build/otp_src_26.2.3/erts/start_scripts/start_clean.script
Crash: error:undef
[{systools,compile_rel,
           ["/home/marce/build/otp_src_26.2.3/erts/start_scripts/start_clean",
            "/home/marce/build/otp_src_26.2.3/erts/start_scripts/start_clean",
            {options,["/home/marce/build/otp_src_26.2.3/lib/kernel/ebin",
                      "/home/marce/build/otp_src_26.2.3/lib/stdlib/ebin",
                      "/home/marce/build/otp_src_26.2.3/lib/sasl/ebin"],
                     "/home/marce/build/otp_src_26.2.3/erts/start_scripts",
                     undefined,[],1,false,999,
                     [no_warn_sasl],
                     [],
                     "/home/marce/build/otp_src_26.2.3/erts/start_scripts/tmp"}],
           []},
 {erl_compile,compile_file,4,[{file,"erl_compile.erl"},{line,359}]},
 {erl_compile,compile3,3,[{file,"erl_compile.erl"},{line,317}]},
 {erl_compile,compile,2,[{file,"erl_compile.erl"},{line,61}]},
 {erl_compile,'-compile_cmdline1/1-fun-0-',2,
              [{file,"erl_compile.erl"},{line,74}]}]
```

This was a bit of a red herring, since this was caused by a stream of errors far above in the logs.
Those errors were due to `/usr/ucb/install` not supporting `-p`. It seems that while the erlang
build system defaults to `/usr/ucb/install` in solaris, it uses a flag that does not work there.

Just doing a simple
```
$ sed -i 's|/usr/ucb/install|/usr/bin/install|g' $(grep -l /usr/ucb/install ./**/*)
```

fixed it and I could finish building.
