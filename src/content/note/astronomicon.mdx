import L from '../../components/L.astro'

Just started, this doesn't exist yet. I'm gathering data in order to learn
how to implement this properly.

The idea is to offer an interactive star finder and viewer similar to stellarium
for plan9 and plan9port.

Data Gathering:

+ [Projecting Equatorial Coords into a plane](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/43449/plotting-equatorial-coordinates-to-x-y-plane-simulating-telescope-camera-view)
+ <L name='plan9-draw' from='astronomicon' />

Here's [the repo](https://git.sr.ht/~mcoll/astronomicon/)
The data was gathered using [VizieR](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR) searching for the SAO catalog
and then selecting the computation of ICRS right ascension and declination with J2000 epoch. Then for the compute
columns I want decimal format for the position for the program to work well.
