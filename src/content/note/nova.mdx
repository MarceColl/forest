Nova is a <L name="programming-language" from="nova" /> invented by [(wryl)](https://merveilles.town/@wryl).

You can see an exchange talking about this starting [here](https://elk.zone/functional.cafe/@wryl@merveilles.town/112571072480996408).

It's a very interesting language where you build facts, a bit like Prolog or a Knowledge Graph. Then you pattern match on those facts in order to advance the computation.

Under the language you have an unordered set of n-tuples, then you pattern match on those in order to advance the computation.

For example, let's say you want to have a program that maintains a counter, you start with something like this:

```
Increment was clicked,
The counter is at $count:
  $new_count = $count + 1,
  The counter is at $new_count.

Decrement was clicked,
The counter is at $count:
  $new_count = $count - 1,
  The counter is at $new_count.

The counter is at 0.
```

I don't have access to the implementation or any programs beyond some [examples](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/3716812), so the following is pure speculation.

## Underlying computation mechanism

The statements on the above language serve two different functions:

```
Increment was clicked,
The counter is at $count:
  $new_count = $count + 1,
  The counter is at $new_count.
```

This specifies that if at any time, the tuple `(Increment, was, clicked)`
exists in the tuple database, and the tuple `(The, counter, is, at, _)`
exists, then consume them and replace them with `(The, counter, is, at, _)` with a new value.

If a token that starts with `$` is found in the precondition then that name becomes a variable that takes the value found in the tuple.

For example, if the tuple database contained
```
Tuple 1: (Increment, was, clicked)
Tuple 2: (The, counter, is, at, 4)
```

Then running that computation is something like:
```
delete (Increment, was, clicked)
delete (The, counter, is, at, _)
$count = 4
$new_count = 5 ($count + 1)
insert (The, counter, is, at, 5)
```

Given two operations `delete` and `insert` that operate on the tuple database.

This is very interesting and is a new way of specifying a computation for me. I want to explore this further. This could relate very well with the <L name="explorative-programming" from="nova" /> concept. It would offer very good introspection and iteration, which are fundamental for that.
