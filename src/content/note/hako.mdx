This explores the idea of replacing a traditional relational database
with a raft replicated arbitrary metadata store.

You don't need an ORM if everything is an object already!

This is very much in sync with the <L name="explorative-programming" from="hako" /> ideas.

I've decided to explore this idea in Elixir due to two reasons:

* Everything in elixir is serializable, everything is immutable by default, you can take any object and send it over the wire, including functions.
* Availability of a high quality, robust Raft library with on-disk persistance backed by a WAL -> [`Ra` library](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra).


The idea is to be able to just write data structures and freely replicate them over a cluster of nodes, even if it's only one node. And persist them into disk safely.

This allows you to build Elixir applications WITHOUT a database.

This follows a bit on the ideas of [this post](https://blog.screenshotbot.io/2024/08/10/building-a-highly-available-web-service-without-a-database/) ([HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41206908)).

Everyone there thought it was a dumb idea, but I like it and I think it's nice to test the boundaries of what is now considered *best practices*. Since most of the foundational work is done by the `Ra` library I can focus on the ergonomics of working with an object distributed database.

The name means box in japanese.

TO BE CONTINUED!
