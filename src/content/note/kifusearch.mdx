title: 'Kifu Search'

import L from '../../components/L.astro'

I'm working on a position searcher for Go kifus (game registry). The idea is to be able to search all professional and
Fox games.

The current design is a Phoenix frontend for the whole website interaction, and a super small assembly program that
scans a big mmapped data file that contains the game data. The game data is currently stored as a 512 bit chunk inside the
file.

The chunk contains

* 361 bits of stone positions (0 -> no stone, 1 -> stone), no color is encoded here.
* up to 100 bits of color data, every 1 in the above 361 bitfield from the beggining has its color encoded here: 0 -> black, 1 -> white
* The rest of the bits are an integer id to know which game this refers to.


There is another possible representation I'm thinking about where we have:

```
| game_id | game_settings | moves ... |
```

This makes the scan slower, since we need a step to iterate over the moves, however it results in big space savings.

With 2M games to save the first 100 moves, it would take 12.8 GB of data.
With the second approach, to save the first 100 moves, it would take 266MB and to save all moves assuming an average 200 moves per game
it would be half a gig. This would allow saving 100 million games using only 25GB.

The small ASM program takes two things as arguments

```
$ ./search <pattern> <offset>
```

Pattern is a board pattern in string form, "0001020020100110" in a 4x4 board would be something like this:

```
...x
.O..
O.x.
.xx.
```

The offset is where in the data file to start, when a search concludes and it has found 20 items, the program returns an offset (where it
had to go to find those games), and 20 game ids.

When paging, you give that offset back and it will continue to search from there.
The 20 game ids are then mapped into their SGFs (Smart Game Format, the standard Go kifu format) and returned to the frontend for display.

Preliminary tests suggest a search speed of 100GB/s using this system, which would allow a full 100 million games, in about 2.5 seconds but
I haven't had time to do a thorough benchmark and that number seems a bit sus.

The chunks are checked against the pattern using AVX2 operations, I take a pattern mask, which basically decides on what section I search, then do an AND with the game chunk, this gives me
a subsection of the game that we care about, then I xor the result with the pattern. If the result is 0, then it is a full match.

In equivalent C it is something like this:
```c
if (patt ^ (mask & game) == 0) {
  // match
}
```

or in ASM
```asm
vpand ymm0, ymm0, ymm2
vpxor ymm0, ymm0, ymm1
vptest ymm0, ymm0
```

Where `ymm0` contains the game at the start of the routine, `ymm1` contains the search pattern and `ymm2` contains the search mask.

Since AVX2 instructions operate on 256 bits and the whole pattern is 361 bits, I need to do two times the above operation with different sections. This is the reason by I
set the chunks to 256 bits, so these operations work on aligned 256 bits and I can linearly scan them. This also serves me well to
store the id and 

I want to test it with AVX512, but I don't have a processor that has that extension.
