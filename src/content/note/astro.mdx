While I tend to dislike most Javascript frameworks, this one fit my way of thinking fairly well. It's a highly customizable static site renderer that handles collections of data for you in several formats.

It also allows to add dynamic content if needed by seamlessly rendering some parts while bundling javascript for others. They call this system *Islands*.
