From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension): 

> Right ascension (abbreviated RA; symbol Î±) is the angular distance of a 
> particular point measured eastward along the celestial equator from the Sun at 
> the March equinox to the (hour circle of the) point in question above the 
> Earth.[1] When paired with declination, these astronomical coordinates specify 
> the location of a point on the celestial sphere in the equatorial coordinate 
> system.
